The task is to use an internal and external temperature sensor and voltmeter to monitor the temperature and voltage parameters, reflecting their state using LEDs, when a certain parameter threshold is crossed, the red LED should signal the presence of one or more emergency situations.
Solution: each LED is associated with a specific sensor, green - external sensor, orange internal sensor, blue - voltmeter, when the controlled parameter increases, the brightness of the LED changes, when the controlled parameters pass through the set value, the red LED indicates the presence of an emergency mode, the number of current emergency modes affects to the flashing frequency of the red LED
